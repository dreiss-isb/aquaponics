# aquaponics
Code for aquaponics edu module

Right now this just has python code for parsing Logger Pro data into an Excel spreadsheet.

Eventually, we will want to automatically upload this parsed data into Google drive (?)...

## Plan:

1. Automatically run parser when file is uploaded.
2. Automatically upload to google drive.
 a. May require python and googlecl (difficult to set up on Windows?)
 b. See: http://hyperlogos.org/blog/drink/Install-GoogleCL-Windows
3. Use [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) to visualize.
4. Learn!
